1. Both companies emphasize the importance of being kind and attempting to minimize friction
especially when correcting another peron's work. Both also highlight the importance of constant
feedback, helping people fix mistakes quickly instead of letting them build up. The yelp article 
states taht reviewing your own code, making sure it complies with the project descriptionand that 
it is the best work you could have putten forward is very important, but this is not fully 
mentioned in the other article.  The second article also highlights the emoji feedback 
technique, but this is omitted from the yelp article.  A proper code review checklist should
include a check for code quality as well as proper testing of all code.  It should also 
be completed in a timely manner. You should also make sure that all relevant documentation is
readily available to those that might need it.

    This review was helpful because it pointed out clear flaws in the user's code and provided clear and easy ways to fix them.
    It was kind to the user who posted the code and gave examples of how the code could be fixed with an explanation.

    https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/289445/java-code-to-delete-all-empty-folders-within-a-directory
    This review was not super helpful because it only addressed one of the many issues within the code.
    The reviewer points out one error in the code and provides an example of how to fix it, however, from
    other reviews of the same code, it is clear that there are many other, more detrimental errors. This review should
    be more comprehensive, instead of only focusing on one small error.
